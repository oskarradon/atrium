        In the great night before all things, there was a vast body of water, dark, still, and unending.
        <br><br>
        From these waters, in the moment of the first differentiation, rose a great ball of light, and on her shoulders she raised the sky (and called herself the Sun).
        <br><br>
        Alone She shone above the waters, saw her reflection and considered.
        <br><br>
        In the second differentiation, She drew from herself and extended herself into another, companion and mirror.
        <br><br>
        Her She called the Moon.
        <br><br>
        And there were two suspended above the waters, warm and cool.
        <br><br>
        And they knew themselves to be as one in two forms.
        <br><br>
        Now She reached down golden fingers and drew from the waters points of land that arched upward toward her light.
        <br><br>
        And reached down again and brushed her fingertips across the land, and where She touched it green things grew and followed her movement across the sky.
        <br><br>
        And the Moon too reached down and traced silvery fingers across the vast waters which followed her movement across the sky.
        <br><br>
        And still great water and Sun and Moon and living land and green things knew themselves to be as one in myriad forms.
